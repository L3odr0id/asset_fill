## Usage

- Make sure that your `pubspec.yaml` declares a `flutter` map and the `assets` list that contains at least one placeholder element as shown below. Consider checking the [example](https://github.com/L3odr0id/asset_fill/blob/61479a2aafa1e3040063df828b153dbe4619419c/example/pubspec.yaml#L56).
```yaml
flutter:
  # stuff
  assets:
    - placeholder
```
- Place your files and folders to an assets directory.
- Execute following command:

```bash
flutter pub run asset_fill
```
- Remove the placeholder
